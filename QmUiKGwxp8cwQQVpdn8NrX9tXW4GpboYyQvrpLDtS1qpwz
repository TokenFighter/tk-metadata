  "description": "In computing, a null pointer or null reference has a value saved for indicating that the pointer or reference does not refer to a valid object. Programs routinely use null pointers to represent conditions such as the end of a list of unknown lengths or the failure to perform some action; burning tokens refers to sending tokens to a null address."
